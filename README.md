This sample uses the frontend/backend sample from a [dotnet/tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/tree/master/samples/frontend-backend) but also adds an ingress controller to the cluster to expose a public IP address for the frontend application. The GitHub action will use tye in conjunction with an [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/?WT.mc_id=blog-appsonazure-shboyer) cluster and [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/?WT.mc_id=blog-appsonazure-shboyer).
